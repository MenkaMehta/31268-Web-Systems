                          to  <br> multiple pages in this website for eg .header was used to provide

                           For example  <br>#comments-text was used to provide specific color to my h1 text <br>
                            and the same to  contents text.</td>

                            or differentiate the simportant words by giving them a bluish color.  </td>

                      how users should perceive your page (about half page)
                      Perceive means become aware or concious of something, come to realise or understand
                      what effects you were trying to achieve (abt half a page) -->
                        <h2><span class="imp-words"><u>Aesthetics</u></span></h2>
                        <p>This is a simple designed website that is made for my web systems assignment.
                        It has all features and styles that would attract both aged and young people, especially
                      today's young generation.
                      The colourscheme chosen is a combination of light neon colors on the
                          darkbackground. The chosen colors are among the famous colours liked by most
                        people which will attract more users.  This website contains a user friendly design
                     that has been achieved by the usage of attractive colours on different pages eg pink,
                   purple, yellow and green.  </p>

                   <p>The navigation bar at the top of the page and the center of the header class makes use
                   of the active and hover selectors. The link buttons are initially given different colors such as
                 pink, purple, yellow and green. When the mouse hovers on the link-buttons the text within
              the button, get underlined and when the user presses a button, then the current page's link-button changes
             it's colour to blue. </p>

             <p>To avoid the scrolling back up again for long pages like (Past and Comments page), a link
             to the top of the page is made in the footer section named "Top". This will make it easy for the users
             to scroll back to the top with a click after reaching the end of the page.</p>
             <!-- when you add the top link, write about it here -->
                        <h2><span class="imp-words"><u>Accessibility</u></span></h2>
                        <!-- 3. Accecibility
                        eg how you made your website usable by disabled users       -->
                      <p>All images in this website have been given <i>alt</i> attribute, therefore the users who cannot
                      see or are colorblind , can get alternative information in the place of the image.</p>

                      <p> On each page of this website, a <i>viewport metatag</i> has been configured with width=device-width.
                      This allows adjustment in viewing the website in any screen size of the device it is being viewed on.
                    This means the website can be viewed on a small screen like a mobile phone screen or normal laptop screen,
                  as well as the large computer monitor screens.</p>

                  <p>This site has been tested in different browsers like Internet explorer, Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome.
                  It is great that it displayed right for all the browsers it was tested on.</p>
