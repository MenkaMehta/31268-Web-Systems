<!--  past.html describes your expreriences with computing so far (eg mention your HSC experience, past work experience, etc)
My experience with computers:
since young I always had a hands on with computers. My dad owns a small internet cafe service that provides customers with internet and computer using services
and I normally used to help out there and learn stuffs from there. At that time we had a cathoderay tube pc in our house that was a pc fior playing games. so me and
my younger brother played GTA in it and other games.

2007- I first did my official computer course and learnt Ms excel, Ms word, and ....etc
2008 - 2011, I started taking computer studies at school. At start it was boring learning more of the theory stuffs on how computers were invented and blablabla...
2011- I topped in my National Exams and so I was gifted my first laptop that I use till today :-)
2017- After six years it doesnt look the same as 2011, its quite old now, but I still love it.

                <p>I grew up seeing my dad changing computers as shown below:</p>
