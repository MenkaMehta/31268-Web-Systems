                <h2>My Future plans</h2>
                <img alt = "picture" src = "oh_hi_there.png">
                <p> The laptop I am using today is the one I was gifted 6 years ago.
                    It doesn't look the same anymore but I still love it :-)
                    Being a Software Engineer, I have dedicated my life to computing devices.
                    <!-- I easily get attracted to latest computing gadgets. -->
                    Besides doing Software Engineering Core subjects,I have structured my study plan
                    such that I am utilising my electives to do some relevant subjects ie Web Systems,
                    Cloud Computing and Software as a service, plus I am planning to do .NET, Database
                    Fundamentals and Mobile Applications Development in future which would help me in
                    my career ahead. It will increase the list of professions, I can undertake in future. </p>

                    <p>My future career goal is working as a Software Developer or a Technical Business Analyst.
                        After my Bachelors degree, I am planning to take a working break for 2-3 years and later
                        I want to head back to uni for Masters or PHD.</p>
                        <p>One more thing that I would like to share about myself is, "I love coding". It has now become
                            my hobby to learn new programming languages. So far, I know <u><b>assembly</b></u> which is a
                            low level programming language plus some high level programming languages such as <u><b>Java</b></u>,
                            <u><b> C-programming</b></u> and <u><b>Python</b></u>.The programming language, I learn online during
                            my free time is <u><b>Ruby on Rails</b></u>.In order to achieve my goals ahead, computing devices
                            are going to my best companions in my journey to success!!! Therefore, I also have to be a good friend to them :-)</p>
