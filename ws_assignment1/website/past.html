                      <p>Hi again! Since you are visiting this page means you are interested in knowing about my past
                       experience with computing devices. My experience with computers started when I was a child. My dad
                       owned a small internet cafe, therefore I grew up seeing different computing devices around me. While helping
                     my dad and the staff there, my motivation towards computing gadgets increased. I was happy as I was learning
                   more and  more each day I spent at the internet cafe.</p>
                       <!-- <h2 align = "center">Experience</h2> -->
                           <h2><span class="imp-words">Experience</span></h2>
                           <p>The first computers I saw in the internet cafe were the computers with the cathode ray monitors as shown below.
                           After some years, dad changed all computers to flat screen monitors. The following is the trend of computer changing I experienced.</p>
