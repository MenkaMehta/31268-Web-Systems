                      <p> The laptop I am using today is the one I was gifted 6 years ago.
                          It doesn't look the same anymore but I still love it :-)
                          Being a Software Engineer, I have dedicated my life to computing devices.
                          <!-- I easily get attracted to latest computing gadgets. -->
                          Besides doing Software Engineering Core subjects,I have structured my study plan
                          such that I am utilising my electives to do some relevant subjects ie Web Systems,
                          Cloud Computing and Software as a service, plus I am planning to do .NET, Database
                          Fundamentals and Mobile Applications Development in future which would help me in
                          my career ahead. It will increase the list of professions, I can undertake in future.</p>

                          <p>My future career goal is working as a Software Developer or a Technical Business Analyst.
                              After my Bachelors degree, I am planning to take a working break for 2-3 years and later
                              I want to head back to uni for <span class="imp-words">Masters or PHD.</span></p>
                              <p>One more thing that I would like to share about myself is, "I love coding". It has now become
                                  my hobby to learn new programming languages. So far, I know <span class="imp-words">assembly</span> which is a
                                  low level programming language plus some high level programming languages such as <span class="imp-words">Java</span>,
                                  <span class="imp-words">C-programming</span> and <span class="imp-words">Python</span>.The programming language, I learn online during
                                  my free time is <span class="imp-words">Ruby on Rails</span>.In order to achieve my goals ahead, computing devices
                                  are going to be my best companions in my journey to success!!! Therefore, I also have to be a good friend to them :-)</p>
